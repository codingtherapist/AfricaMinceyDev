Hi, Iâ€™m Africa! I am an Occupational Therapist and Software Engineer specializing in assistive technology, full-stack web development, and yoga therapy. My passion is working with technology to increase accessibility for neuro-typical individuals as well as those with cognitive, physical, and emotional needs. My desire is to be an advocate for users of technology and build meaningful relationships rooted in finding creative solutions to technical problems.

I share yoga tips for computer users, as well as talk about my journey merging therapy and technology on my YouTube channel: https://youtube.com/user/africakenyah

I have extensive experience with collaboration and supervision of multi functional teams, teaching and presenting of complex ideas and concepts, sections 504 and 508 of the ADA, accessibility and inclusion. I use web development tools to create dynamic web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, express, mongoDB and node.JS.

I am interested in increasing innovation and usability for virtual tools and platforms using universal design that can benefit people of all abilities. I believe thoughtful user research and design can transform telemedicine and digital space for the better. I look forward to expanding my knowledge and reach in the technology and healthcare industry as a therapist, software engineer, and accessibility specialist.
