### Greetings! 

Thank you for visiting my page and checking out some of my work. I'm excited to learn in public and share my full stack web development journey. This page will feature education, tutorials and musings in text and video format of my therapeutic programming projects. This will include both Yoga for Tech Workers and building responsive web applications using html, css, javascript, node.js, express and react.
 
My desire is to educate, develop relationships and build community using technology as a catalyst for connection. I use my background as a virtual therapist and my experience providing assistive technology and yoga therapy services to advocate for both users and creators of technology. 
 
Ultimately, Iâ€™d like to highlight the dynamic intersection of technology and health, while increasing web accessibility and developer wellbeing. 
I hope you enjoy the ride!
