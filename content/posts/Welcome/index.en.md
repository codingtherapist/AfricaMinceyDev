### Greetings! 

Welcome to my body of work. My desire is to educate, advocate for developer well-being, and build community using technology as a catalyst for connection. I'm excited to learn in public and share my full-stack web development journey while highlighting assistive technology and web accessibility. This page will feature education, tutorials, and musings in text and video format of my therapeutic programming projects. This will include both Yoga for Tech Workers and building responsive web applications using HTML, CSS, javascript, node.js, express and react.
I use my background as a virtual therapist and my experience providing assistive technology and yoga therapy services to advocate for both users and creators of technology.
Ultimately, Iâ€™d like to highlight the dynamic intersection of technology and health, while increasing web accessibility and developer wellbeing.
I hope you enjoy the ride!
