### Hi!

Thanks for visiting my page and checking out some of my work. I'm excited to share my web developement and virtual therapy projects, and learn in public. I've been focusing on advocating for web accessibility while building web applications that increase wellness with therapeutic movement using javascript, node.js, golang, and express.
