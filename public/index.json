Thank you for visiting my page and checking out some of my work. I’m excited to learn in public and share my full stack web development journey. This page will feature education, tutorials and musings in text and video format of my therapeutic programming projects. This will include both Yoga for Tech Workers and building responsive web applications using html, css, javascript, node.js, express and react. My desire is to educate, develop relationships and build community using technology as a catalyst for connection. I use my background as a virtual therapist and my experience providing assistive technology and yoga therapy services to advocate for both users and creators of technology. Ultimately, I’d like to highlight the dynamic intersection of technology and health, while increasing web accessibility and developer wellbeing. I hope you enjoy the ride!

Lately, I find myself spending very long hours on the computer. During the day I see patients on zoom, then abuse my keyboard to complete evaluations and daily documentation. The rest of my free time is spent with even more screens, learning how to code, watching tutorials, editing videos, the list goes on. When your job and all your hobbies involve staring at screens Needless to say, my whole body has been aching, especially my wrists. While we could go further by talking about ergonomics to prevent wrist pain, we will save that for another blog post and focus on stretches to prevent and alleviate wrist tension from repetitive motions. If you would like to watch the 7-minute chair yoga video on youtube for better clarity on how to do these movements click here. Otherwise, see below for five of my favorite chair yoga wrist stretches. Try these at the top of every hour for 3-5 minutes and remember to breathe! 5 Stretches for the Wrist ","date":"2022-07-13","objectID":"/handexercises/:0:0","tags":["yoga therapy"],"title":"5 Stretches for the Wrist for Computer Users","uri":"/handexercises/"},{"categories":["yoga"],"content":"1. Seated Downward Wrist Press This is one of my favorite stretches of all time. You will feel this in your wrist flexors in the forearm. If you are unable to get your hand all the way backward, that is fine. Just rotate as far as it will go without pain. Place your hand at the hip, press down slowly, and take 2 deep breaths. Bring both hands down beside your hips, and breathe in deeply for 2-3 breaths. If you’d like to go further into this stretch, try an overhead stretch and bring the opposite hand overhead.

Supination and Pronation Press Be very careful with this stretch, especially if you have pain in the wrist. Skip it and consult your physician if you have any injuries. Start with supination and pronation of the wrist to warm up supinator and pronator muscles. Supination: Take a breath in as you supinate Pronation: Take a breath out as you pronate your wrist Supination Press: Go very slowly, placing your other hand under your supinated hand, and slowly turn the hand in the opposite direction of the “pouring” motion while breathing in deeply. Hold for another breath and release. Switch hands Pronation Press: Go very slowly, placing your other hand under your pronated hand, and slowly turn the hand in the direction of the “pouring” motion. Switch hands I hope these stretches are helpful and give you some wrist relief. Remember to stretch at the top of the hour, even if only for one minute!

I know, kind of boring, but hear me out! It has come up recently in conversations in digital spaces. Web developers are asking themselves, does HTML semantics really matter? I’d like to toss my reply in the ring: HTML semantics ABSOLUTELY matter. It is often the thing stopping users from being able to use your website. I am so passionate about this because I have seen firsthand how users of assistive technology, which rely on reading HTML to give information to the user, are impacted. Imagine being unable to participate in daily living activities like using the web and its applications (where we spend a lot of our time and use for so many things) due to technical barriers. Think about how frustrating it would be to pay your water/rent bill, or figure out what you’re going to cook tonight because almost each recipe website is a jumble of words that takes 30 minutes to shift through. For individuals with impairments who use devices like screen readers, your HTML is how they navigate your websites. If there are a bunch of divs with no markup that makes sense, they will not be able to understand what is on your page, what is important, or what should be clicked on. Before I started my full-stack web development journey, I delivered occupational therapy services to patients using screen readers. They had difficulty on many sites due to the screen reader not being able to make sense of the context of information being spit out by the program (programs used included voiceover for mac, NVDA for windows, and JAWS). We assumed that it must be really complicated to code these websites and have them interact with the programs we were using. Now that I’ve learned the basics of HTML, CSS, javascript, and a little backend, I have a new perspective. I realize a lot of developers just don’t know how impactful the simple HTML code they write is. This makes sense, it is just not something we typically consider. Able-bodied people typically interact with other able-bodied people. It is easy to forget the many neurotypical individuals and those living with low sight, low hearing, upper extremity weakness, mobility difficulties, and other silent disorders. They want to read/ hear memes, pay bills, and interact with loved ones on the internet just like us. Accessibility and universal design do not seem to be taught as more than an afterthought in many school curriculums and coding boot camps. So it may be, at the end of the day, up to us to advocate for those who are unable to be in the room to advocate for themselves. The best part is it will not completely derail what you’re already doing or force you to learn anything too complicated. Accessibility just asks that you be mindful, considerate, and design for the good of ALL. Remember, it’s way easier to code with web accessibility in mind than it is to go back in and change a bunch of things so that everyone regardless of abilities can use your sites. While this short article does not have a list of actionable steps you can take to make your websites more accessible (I’m working on this), I hope it gets you thinking about ways to be more inclusive. Actually, I will leave you with one accessibility reminder that everyone knows but for some reason is often not added to basic pages: Please include alt text on your images. Every time. We appreciate your kind efforts! Interested in learning more? A few days before this, I uploaded a video on different kinds of assistive technology and why it matters for developers, teachers, and healthcare workers. Video: What is Assistive Technology?
